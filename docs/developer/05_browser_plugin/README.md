## Overview
The browser plugin for the Decentralized Content Filter project provides a front-end interface that allows users to filter, vote on, and customize content across various websites. This plugin interacts with decentralized backend instances and a smart contract to pull filtering data, manage voting, and apply user-driven content moderation rules directly in the browser.

### Technology Stack
- **Browser Extension API**: Compatible with Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and potentially Safari (using the WebExtensions API)
- **Frontend Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript, React, or Vue.js for handling UI components
- **Blockchain Library**: Web3.js or Ethers.js to connect to the smart contract and manage on-chain voting and karma

---

## Plugin Requirements

1. **WebExtensions API**: Use the WebExtensions API to build a cross-browser compatible plugin.
2. **Backend Connectivity**: Establish connectivity to backend instances for data on content filtering, karma management, and uberscript syncing.
3. **Blockchain Connectivity**: Utilize Web3.js or Ethers.js to interact with the smart contract for on-chain voting, karma management, and uberscript approvals.

---

## Extension Structure

1. **manifest.json**: Defines the extension’s metadata, permissions, and scripts.
2. **Background Script**: Manages connections to the backend and smart contract, handles data syncing, and maintains user settings.
3. **Content Script**: Injected into web pages to handle content filtering, uberscript application, and real-time UI modifications.
4. **Popup UI**: Primary user interface for content interactions, including voting, karma display, and filtering settings.
5. **Options Page**: Provides users with customization options for content filtering, uberscript management, and backend instance selection.

## Core Functionalities

### Content Filtering and Display
   - **Purpose**: Filter and alter content on web pages based on user preferences and community-driven flags.
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - **Content Script**: Inject JavaScript into each page to identify, hide, or modify flagged content according to filtering rules from the backend.
     - **Filtering Rules**: Use JSON data from backend instances to determine flagged content, applying hide, block, or gray-out effects.
     - **User Controls**: Enable users to adjust filtering preferences through the options page for granular customization.

### Voting and Submissions
   - **Purpose**: Allow users to submit flagged content and vote on existing submissions.
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - **Voting API Call**: Call the backend `/vote` API to upvote or downvote flagged content.
     - **Submission API Call**: Use the `/submit` API to send flagged content along with metadata like content link and reason for flagging.
     - **UI Integration**: Add vote buttons and submission options to flagged content items, with visual indicators of vote counts.

### Karma Display and Management
   - **Purpose**: Display and manage user karma based on their actions (voting, flagging, and submissions).
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - **Karma Fetching**: Retrieve the user’s karma balance from the backend or smart contract.
     - **Display Options**: Allow users to toggle karma visibility, either on the toolbar icon or alongside flagged content.
     - **Karma Deduction**: Deduct karma for each vote or submission to regulate usage and prevent spamming.

### Uberscript Application
   - **Purpose**: Apply community-approved UI overrides, or uberscripts, to enhance or simplify web pages.
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - **Script Fetching**: Download uberscripts from the backend instance, applying them to pages using the content script.
     - **Default and Optional Scripts**: Apply community-approved (default) uberscripts automatically, with additional optional scripts available for manual selection.
     - **Uberscript Parsing**: Parse JSON-defined uberscripts to modify CSS and HTML, enabling UI customizations.

---

## Backend Integration

1. **Instance Selection**: Allow users to choose from a list of backend instances, or input a custom instance URL.
2. **Data Syncing**:
   - **Content Filtering Data**: Sync flagged content data periodically from the selected backend instance.
   - **Karma and Voting Data**: Send and receive updates for karma and votes to maintain up-to-date user interactions.
3. **API Error Handling**: Implement error handling to manage connectivity issues and notify users if syncing fails.

---

## UI Customization Options

1. **Content Filtering Settings**:
   - **Options**: Users can choose between blocking, hiding, graying out, or marking flagged content.
   - **Visibility Settings**: Allow users to set thresholds for displaying karma or vote counts.

2. **Uberscript Management**:
   - **Default Scripts**: Automatically apply high-karma community-approved uberscripts.
   - **Optional Scripts**: Provide a list of optional uberscripts for manual selection.
   - **Customization**: Let users prioritize or configure settings for specific uberscripts.

3. **Instance Selection and Connectivity**:
   - **Trusted Instances List**: Display a list of vetted instances, with options to add custom instance URLs.
   - **Network Preference**: Users can switch between public instances and local/private instances for added control.

## Deployment and Testing

### Development
1. **Local Development**: Use your browser’s developer tools to load the unpacked extension for testing.
2. **API Testing**: Use Postman or a similar tool to test backend endpoints independently before full integration.
3. **Debugging**: Use dev tools to monitor content script and background script actions in real-time.

### Testing
1. **Unit Testing**: Test individual components, including content filtering, voting, and backend syncing.
2. **End-to-End Testing**: Test the full functionality, from flagging content to syncing karma and uberscript application.
3. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Test the extension on Firefox, Chrome, and potentially other WebExtensions-compatible browsers.

### Packaging
1. **Manifest Check**: Verify that permissions and required fields are correctly defined in `manifest.json`.
2. **Build and Package**: Package the extension as an `.xpi` or `.crx` file, depending on the target browser.
3. **Submission**: Submit to the appropriate browser extension store for review and approval.

---

## Permissions and Security

1. **Minimal Permissions**: Request only necessary permissions in `manifest.json`.
2. **Content Script Isolation**: Sandbox content scripts to limit access to sensitive data.
3. **Privacy-First Data Storage**: Use local storage only for non-sensitive settings, and avoid collecting personal data.
4. **Rate Limiting for API Requests**: Implement rate limiting for backend requests to prevent accidental overloading.
