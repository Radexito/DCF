# Uberscripts
   - **Purpose**: Provide community-voted UI overrides for supported websites to improve user experience.
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - **Technology**: JSON for uberscript definition, smart contract voting, and ranking logic, with integration into the browser plugin using a JSON interpreter to override the DOM.
     - **Structure**:
       - Default uberscripts: Voted on and approved scripts that apply automatically for all users.
       - Optional uberscripts: Allow users to browse, install, and apply custom uberscripts as desired.
     - **Smart Contract Voting**: Implement a voting function to track community preferences for uberscripts. Top-rated scripts become defaults.
     - **Frontend Integration**: Browser plugin interprets uberscript JSON, modifying CSS and HTML nodes to customize UI without impacting core content.
