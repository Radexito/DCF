# Backend Instances
   - **Purpose**: Establish a decentralized network of instances that host data, handle requests, and communicate with the smart contract.
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - **Technology**: Flask or Express.js for REST API on the backend; PostgreSQL or MongoDB for local data storage.
     - **Permissions**:
       - Each instance must register with the smart contract to receive a unique ID and access permissions.
       - **Public Port Access**: Require a designated public port for backend data sharing to qualify for community rewards.
       - **Syncing Logic**: Regularly sync backend instance data with the smart contract to maintain an up-to-date list of trusted instances.
