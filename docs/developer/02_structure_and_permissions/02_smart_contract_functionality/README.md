# Smart Contract Functionality
   - **Purpose**: Core smart contract to handle registration, voting, karma, and uberscript selection in a secure, decentralized manner.
   - **Implementation Details**:
     - **Technology**: Solidity for smart contract, deploying on Ethereum or Polygon network for scalability.
     - **Functions**:
       - **RegisterInstance**: Records new backend instances with unique IDs and sets permissions.
       - **Vote**: Allows karma-based voting for submissions and uberscripts.
       - **UpdateKarma**: Adjusts karma balances based on actions and interactions.
       - **ApproveUberscript**: Confirms community-approved uberscripts for default application.
     - **Security**: Limit access to certain functions based on karma thresholds, ensuring only trusted instances and high-karma users can influence critical decisions.
